A classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe rebuilt with a modern tech stack and a strategic twist.

## About The Project

This project was developed as an exercise to showcase proficiency in modern front-end technologies and to demonstrate the ability to enhance a classic concept with a unique feature. The standard Tic-Tac-Toe is often a solved game, but the introduction of the "Hidden Joker Square" adds a layer of surprise.

### The Twist: The Hidden Joker Square üÉè

-   **Secret Location:** At the start of each game, one of the 9 squares is secretly designated as the Joker Square.
-   **Conditional Power:** Finding the Joker Square is only half the battle. Its special power‚Äîcapturing an opponent's piece‚Äîcan only be activated if your opponent already has at least one piece on the board.
-   **Game-Changing Move:** If you click on the Joker Square and its power is active, you not only claim that square but also get to convert one of your opponent's existing pieces into your own. This can instantly shift the balance of power and create unexpected paths to victory.

## Features

-   **Classic Tic-Tac-Toe Logic:** All the standard rules you know and love.
-   **Hidden Joker Mechanic:** Adds depth and high replayability.
-   **Sleek & Responsive UI:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern look on all devices.
-   **Clear Game Status:** Instant feedback on the current player, game-winning moves, draws, and special actions.
-   **State Management with Custom Hooks:** The entire game logic is encapsulated in a clean, reusable `useTicTacToe` custom hook.
-   **Type-Safe Codebase:** Built with TypeScript to ensure reliability and maintainability.
